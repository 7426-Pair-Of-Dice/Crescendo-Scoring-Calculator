## Usage

This calculator can be useful for scoring practice matches, comparing the scores of multiple previous matches, coming up with strategies or even as a tool for conducting driver tryouts.

## How to use

If for whatever reason you wish to run this yourself, all that is required is node.js and the following instructions:

### Install Dependencies

npm install
```

### Run Live Server

npm run dev
```

If you would like a version you can host as a static site, you can create a build or use the latest build found in /docs.
```bash
npm run build
```
